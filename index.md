<h2>New Year, Same Story: San Fransisco's Assaults Renewed</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
A comprehensive dataset spanning from January 2003 to December 2017, detailing incidents recorded by the San Francisco Police Department, uncovers a troubling trend. Among the various crimes recorded, one stands out: assaults.

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
Throughout this 15-year period, the average daily count of reported assaults hovered between 28 and 32. However, an alarming deviation is consistently observed on the first day of each new year. On January 1st each year, the number of reported assaults incidents spike remarkably, with reported cases ranging from 47 and 80, averaging out to 56 reported assaults - which is significantly higher than the daily average! This trend becomes evident when reviewing the calendar plot illustrating recorded assault crimes from 2003 to 2017 (See Figure 1). On some days throughout the different years, there is also a high incident count, but no clear pattern emerges as it does with January 1st. In some years, December 31st also exhibits a high count of incidents, which might be attributed to whether officers 'round up' the documentation clock-time to 00:00, or perhaps due to some officers having a shift change around this hour. This rounding up or shift change could influence whether an incident is recorded as belonging to January 1st or December 31st, providing a possible explanation for the fluctuation in incident counts on these dates.

If you were planning to celebrate New Year's Eve in San Francisco, it's crucial to know which areas might be safer than others. To provide insights, we investigated the top 7 locations where people gather to watch fireworks and mapped them out [1]. Our goal was to determine if these popular spots correlate with higher rates of assault incidents, as large crowds often attract incidents.

Figure 2 shows a map of San Fransisco and its' ten police districts where each district is described with its count of recorded assault crimes per 10,000 residents. The information about residents in each district was gathered from [2].

Tenderloin emerges as the district with the highest recorded assaults per 10,000 residents, which aligns with its reputation as a high-crime neighborhood [3]. A closer look reveals that Tenderloin had a total of 88 recorded assault incidents, surpassing other districts such as Richmond, Taraval, Park, Ingleside, and Bayview.

Southern district follows closely with the second-highest number of assault incidents per 10,000 residents. Interestingly, although it hosts two popular fireworks viewing spots, our analysis indicates that the incidents are not necessarily concentrated near these locations. Thus, the presence of fireworks viewing spots might not significantly influence assault crime rates in this district.

Central district ranks third in terms of assault incidents per 10,000 residents. Notably, our analysis reveals a concerning trend: both Southern and Central districts have a considerable number of recorded incidents near the "border" with Tenderloin. This finding strongly suggests that these areas, especially on New Year's Eve, warrant caution and avoidance.

In conclusion, understanding the distribution of assault incidents relative to popular New Year's Eve fireworks viewing spots can inform safer celebration plans, highlighting areas to avoid, particularly those neighboring high-crime districts like Tenderloin.
