<h1>New Year, Same Story: San Fransisco's Assaults Renewed</h1>

<p>
  Throughout this 15-year period, the average daily count of reported assaults hovered between 28 and 32. However, an alarming deviation is consistently observed on the first day of each new year. On January 1st each year, the number of reported assaults incidents spike remarkably, with reported cases ranging from 47 and 80, averaging out to 56 reported assaults - which is significantly higher than the daily average! This trend becomes evident when reviewing the calendar plot illustrating recorded assault crimes from 2003 to 2017 (See Figure 1). On some days throughout the different years, there is also a high incident count, but no clear pattern emerges as it does with January 1st. In some years, December 31st also exhibits a high count of incidents, which might be attributed to whether officers 'round up' the documentation clock-time to 00:00, or perhaps due to some officers having a shift change around this hour. This rounding up or shift change could influence whether an incident is recorded as belonging to January 1st or December 31st, providing a possible explanation for the fluctuation in incident counts on these dates.
